# Docx-Template-Filler
This program helps to fill a document with markers using Google Collab Jupyter Notebook
# Currently it only works with tables (WIP and the sourcecode is hardcoded for a certain example for some columns, but can be easily arranged with some for loops and lists extracted with pandas).
